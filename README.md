# HPIPS_Chain
为了满足HPIPS自身的业务需求，HPIPS将会开发符合自身需求的共识机制，现在确定的需要的业务需求有POW，DAG，和IPFS等主要的技术领域。会在后期不断的完善各种业务需求，目前第一阶段会部署NULS子链和以太的智能合约。

In order to meet the business needs of HPIPS itself, HPIPS will develop a consensus mechanism that meets its own needs. The required business needs are now identified in the main technical areas such as POW, DAG, and IPFS. In the later period, we will continue to improve various business needs. Currently, the first phase will deploy NULS sub-chains and Ethernet smart contracts.
